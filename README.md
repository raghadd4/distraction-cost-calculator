# Distraction Cost Calculator

A Python program that analyzes productivity distractions by calculating a weighted cost based on time wasted and task importance.

## What it does
- Allows users to enter multiple distractions
- Collects user-reported distractions
- Assigns an importance level (1–5) to each distraction
- Calculates a cost score using time × importance
- Displays a summary and total distraction cost
- Identifies the highest-cost distraction based on impact


## Why this project
Time-based tracking alone doesn’t reflect real productivity loss.  
This project focuses on **impact**, not just duration.

## Technologies used
- Python
- Functions
- Loops
- Lists and dictionaries

## Example
Task name: YouTube
Importance (1–5): 3
Time wasted (minutes): 40

Task name: Instagram
Importance (1–5): 2
Time wasted (minutes): 20

Do you want to add another distraction? (y/n): n

--- Distraction Summary ---
YouTube → Cost Score: 120
Instagram → Cost Score: 40

Total Distraction Cost: 160
